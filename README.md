Event Signin
####

Very basic and terribly coded event-sign in platform for our events. This will live [here](http://signin.techatnyu.org).

Aims

- Login via Facebook to authenticate or create the user if he/she doesn't exist
	- Login with Twitter works
- ~~~Know that the user is logged in~~~
- Edit profile if user has logged in
- ~~~Be able to easily look at events happening today~~~
- ~~~Be able to signin/checkin to an event that is happening~~~
- Handle if there are multiple events in a day
- Make it easy for organizers to get a shortlink to the event
